Analysis of customer voice on Disney products using Amazon's customer review data

### Introduction
Disney is one of the world's largest consumer brand for entertainment, fashion, goods, foods and more.
Since the impact of Disney's characters on product sales is huge, many consumer companies have strategic licensing agreement to use its characters in their products and services. 
In this assignment, I suppose I am a marketing analyst in a certain licensee company of Walt Disney.
Although I can analyze sales data within my own company, the data is not sufficient without real feedback from consumers. Eventually after investigation in open data, I turned to Amazon's customer review to gain more insights into consumer's expectation. 

### Historical change in popular character
There is a strong change in popularity of characters in recent years.
Until 2013, number of reviews of Pooh doubled the number of reviews of Mickey and Minnie.
In 2014, the number of reviews of Mickey and Minnie reached to the same level as Pooh.
In 2015, each review of Mickey and Minnie outweighed the reviews of Pooh, indicating the reviews of Pooh has begun to decrease.
This change might be due to the effect of criticism on the Winnie the Pooh in some countries. From some religious perspectives, the characters have been banned from public book shelves.
